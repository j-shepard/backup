Backup one or more volumes.
Multiple backups are saved for today and yesterday, but only one backup for previous days.
When disk space runs low, the oldest backups are deleted first.

A few files need to be changed and the backup directory needs to be initialized.

1. In backup.sh, change SOURCE_DIR, SOURCE_DIR2, etc.
   These generally match mount points.
   The default assumes / and /home are different mount points
   
   Also in backup.sh change EXCLUDE_FILE

2. In exclude, add one line for each pattern to exclude
   ** matches any directory so **/.cache would match /home/myname/.cache and also /.cache

3. In set_backup_environment.sh
   Change BACKUP_DIR to the directory where the files will be stored
   Change DESIRED_FREE to a reasonoble value (in kilobytes) for the size of the disk
      The default is 100000000 (around 100GB) which works well for my backups to a 500GB disk
      This is the trickiest part. This needs to be large enough for multiple incremental backups.
      For example if incremental backups are around 5GB and 10 bacukps are done per day, this needs
      to be more than 50GB. But the larger the number, the fewer the number of backups are retained
      on disk.

4. The backup directory needs to be initialized
   In BACKUP_DIR create an empty directory called back-2011-06-28T22_53_32
   And link this directory to current
     ln -s back-2011-06-28T22_53_32 current
   (The timestamp is arbitrary, it just needs to be in the correct format)


5. backup.sh and cleanup.sh can now be run as needed.
   I usually run backup.sh many times per day, but only run cleanup.sh in the morning.
